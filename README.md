# Video2Sim

Video2Sim is a Docker-based pipeline for converting raw video (or sensor logs) into simulation-ready 3D assets using a sequence of modular components.

## Requirements

- **NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support**
- **200 GB of available disk space**
- **Docker Engine**
- **A Hugging Face access token** with permission to pull from:
  - `https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam3`
- **VRAM considerations**
  - The primary VRAM bottlenecks in the current pipeline are SAM3 and DA3. These stages typically complete in minutes, but output quality depends on the number of frames provided.
  - As a reference point, 380 frames required 80 GB of VRAM.
  - The main process, HoloScene, did not exceed 10 GB of VRAM usage in my tests.
  - Because of this, I recommend renting a cloud GPU to run SAM3 and DA3, then copying the necessary directories (`data/input/custom`) locally (or to a smaller GPU instance) to complete training with HoloScene.

## Pipeline Overview

### Input

Record a horizontal video of the scene while orbiting around it. I recommend researching proper video/image capture techniques for 3D scenes.

### Preprocessor

Takes a video or ROS bag and outputs images.

### DA3 (Depth Anything 3)

Reads extracted frames and produces `transforms.json`, along with additional supporting files. The JSON contains camera intrinsics, extrinsics, and per-frame camera poses.

### SAM 3 (Segment Anything Model 3)

Reads extracted frames and produces consistent per‑frame instance masks. Prompts are defined in `prompts.txt`.

### HoloScene

Uses extracted frames, poses, masks, and Marigold‑generated priors
to reconstruct the 3D scene and export final assets.

## Running the Pipeline

1. **Place input files**  
Place video file into `data/input`.

2. **Configure environment**  
Fill out `.env` (scene name, fps extraction etc.).

3. **Build and run each module in sequence**  
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build preprocessor
    docker compose up --build da3
    docker compose up --build sam3
    docker compose up --build holoscene
    ```

4. **Retrieve results**  
Results will be generated into `data/output`.

**Note:** To keep the container alive for debugging, temporarily set
the command in `docker-compose.yml` to `["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]`."
